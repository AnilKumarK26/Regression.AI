# Regression.AI

## Overview
Regression.AI is a machine learning project focused on implementing regression models to make accurate predictions. This project utilizes various regression techniques to analyze and forecast data trends effectively.

## Features
- Supports multiple regression algorithms (Linear, Polynomial, Ridge, Lasso, etc.).
- User-friendly web interface for inputting data and visualizing results.
- Automated data preprocessing for improved model accuracy.
- Flask-based API for easy integration.
- Real-time predictions and analytics.

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AnilKumarK26/regression-ai.git
   cd regression-ai
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage
- Open the web interface by navigating to `http://localhost:5000`.
- Upload a dataset or enter input values manually.
- Select a regression model and run predictions.
- View graphical visualizations of results.
